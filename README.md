## Bank Loan Analysis and Reporting System
# Project Description
This project analyzes bank loan data to provide comprehensive insights into loan applications, funding, repayments, and risk assessment. The system processes and visualizes key performance indicators (KPIs) to help financial institutions make informed lending decisions and effectively manage their loan portfolios.
Overview
The Bank Loan Analysis and Reporting System extracts valuable information from loan data including:
- Total loan applications, funded amounts, and received payments
- Month-to-date (MTD) and previous-month-to-date (PMTD) comparisons
Average interest rates and debt-to-income ratios
Good vs. bad loan performance metrics
Loan status summaries
Temporal analysis (monthly trends)
Geographic distribution analysis (state-level)
Loan term analysis
Employment length impact on loan performance
Loan purpose categorization
Home ownership influence on loan behavior

# Key Features

Comprehensive KPI Dashboard: Track essential metrics including application counts, funding amounts, received payments, interest rates, and DTI ratios
Good/Bad Loan Analysis: Evaluate loan performance with metrics on fully paid/current loans vs. charged-off loans
Multi-dimensional Analysis: Examine loan data across various dimensions including time period, geography, loan purpose, employment duration, and home ownership
Filterable Reports: Apply filters (such as loan grade) to refine analysis for specific segments
SQL-Powered Analytics: Leverage SQL queries to extract actionable insights from loan data

# Data Structure
The system analyzes a comprehensive loan database with fields including:
Loan identification and borrower information
Loan characteristics (grade, purpose, term, etc.)
Financial metrics (loan amount, interest rate, installment)
Payment history and status tracking
Borrower employment and income details
Risk assessment indicators

# Business Value
This system enables financial institutions to:
Assess overall lending performance
Identify trends in loan applications and funding
Evaluate loan portfolio health through good vs. bad loan analysis
Optimize lending strategies based on multi-dimensional insights
Make data-driven decisions to minimize risk and maximize returns
Monitor regulatory compliance
Segment customers for targeted product offerings

# Technical Implementation
The project utilizes SQL queries to extract and transform loan data into meaningful business intelligence. The analysis is structured into summary reports and detailed overviews that provide both high-level insights and granular details on loan performance.
